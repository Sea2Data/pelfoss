\arguments{
\item{projectName}{The biomass area density in units of g/m^2 (gram per square meter in the horizontal plane).}

\item{xmlOutputDir}{The biomass area density in units of g/m^2 (gram per square meter in the horizontal plane).}

\item{biomass}{The path to a NORWECOM NetCDF4 file with biomass in grams per square meter in a irregular geographical grid. The file should contain the variables "Biom", "Long" and "Latt".}

\item{superInd}{The path to a NORWECOM NetCDF4 file with superindividuals. The file should contain the variables "gridLongInd", "gridLattInd", "gridLong", "gridLatt", "female", "age", "inumb", "length", "sweight" and "pweight".}

\item{stratum}{The path to a file with the stratum polygons given as a two column matrix with stratum name in the first column and a MULTIPOLYGON wkt string in the second conlumn.}

\item{startdate}{The start date of the survey, given as "%d/%m", e.g., 31 January is "31/1".}

\item{dateshift}{An integer number of days to shift the survey by, negative values shifting to earlier in the year.}

\item{centroid}{The centroid of the data, given in longitude, latitude.}

\item{seed}{A single integer, or a list of seeds used in the funciton, including the following seeds: ('transect') for drawing transects using surveyPlanner(), ('trawl') for drawing trawl stations along the transects with probability as a funciton of the NASC (see \code{probfact}), and ('bootstrap') for getting the final estimate using runBootstrap() (see \code{nboot}).}

\item{xsd}{A named list of xsd versions of the acoustic and biotic file format.}

\item{nTrawl}{The number of trawls to draw. Implies a penalty on the total transect time by \code{hoursPerTrawl}.}

\item{type, knots, equalEffort, bearing, distsep, margin}{See \code{\link{surveyPlanner}}}

\item{tsn}{The tsn code of the species.}

\item{m, TS0}{The parameters of the target strength-length relationship TS = m * log10(Lcm) + TS0, typically m = 20 and TS0 = -71.9 (herring, from Foote, K. G. 1987. Fish target strengths for use in echo integrator surveys. Journal of the Acoustical Society of America, 82: 981â€“ 987.)}

\item{platform}{The platform to use, defaulted to G.O.Sars. Only kept for cosmetic reasons.}

\item{distance, sweepWidth}{The trawled distance and the seew width of the simulated trawl.}

\item{probfact}{A numeric indicating an addition in the probability of selecting a log distance for trawling. I.e., add probfact / numberOfTransects to each log distance probability NASC / sum(NASC), and normalize to toal probability = 1.}

\item{radius}{The radius around the trawl station within which individuals are drawn from the superindividuals.}

\item{N}{The number of individuals to draw for each trawl station.}

\item{...}{Arguments passed to \code{\link{surveyPlanner}}.}

\item{daysOfSurvey}{The number of days reserved for the survey.}
